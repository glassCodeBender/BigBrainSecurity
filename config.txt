# BIG BRAIN SECURITY CONFIGURATION FILE
#
# INSTRUCTIONS: To set any of the default settings in the program, remove the
# “#” sign from the line and set the parameter to whatever value you wish
# to use. 
# 
# EXAMPLE: “operating_system ~> Windows” is on a line without a “#” sign so
# so the computer will read the line and include it as a part of the program. 
# “filter_suspicious ~> false” on the other hand, is preceded by a “#” sign so the value
# “true” is not read by the program. 
# 
# NOTE: ONLY LINES WITHOUT A “#” SIGN are read by the program.
# 
# THE FOLLOWING LINES DICTATE HOW THE PROGRAM OPERATES:
#
# INSTRUCTION: The only two options for the Operating System (OS) is “Mac” or “Windows”
operating_system ~> Windows
#
# INSTRUCTION: The following “true” and “false” statements are CASE SENSITIVE:
create_integer_index ~> true
default_filter ~> true
# filter_supicious ~> false
# start_index ~> 0
# end_index ~> 500000
# start_time ~> 00:00:00
